# Analyzing-CIA-Factbook-Data-Using-SQLite-and-Python

We will work with data from the [CIA World Factbook](https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/), a compendium of statistics about all of the countries on Earth. The Factbook contains demographic information like:

* population - The population as of 2015.
* population_growth - The annual population growth rate, as a percentage.
* area - The total land and water area.
You can download the SQLite database, factbook.db, from [this GitHub repo](https://github.com/factbook/factbook.sql/releases) if you want to work with it on your own computer. In this guided project, we'll explore the Python SQLite workflow to explore, analyze, and visualize data from this database.
